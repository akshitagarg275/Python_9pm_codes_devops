'''
Operators -> It allows us to performn the operations

there are two types of operators
unary operator -> Only one operand is required

binary operators -> two operands are required
Arithmetic Opeators
Assignment Operators
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators

Membership Operator
Identity Operator
