'''
Operators -> It allows us to performn the operations

there are two types of operators
unary operator -> Only one operand is required

binary operators -> two operands are required
Arithmetic Opeators
Assignment Operators
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Binary Operators

Membership Operator
Identity Operator

It returns boolean value (True/False)

> : Greater than
< : Lesser than

NOTE: It will return True if either LHS value is greater/lesser than or equal to RHS value
>= : Greater than equal to
<= : Lesser than equal to


== : Equality
!= : Not equal to
