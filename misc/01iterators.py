'''
In Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a sequence of elements, 
one at a time, without having to know the underlying data structure or implementation details. 
It provides a common interface for iterating over various types of collections such as 
lists, tuples, dictionaries, and custom-defined objects.

The iterator protocol in Python consists of two methods:

__iter__: This method returns the iterator object itself and is required for an object to be considered an iterator.

__next__: This method returns the next element in the sequence. When there are no more elements to be returned, it raises the StopIteration exception to signal the end of iteration.
