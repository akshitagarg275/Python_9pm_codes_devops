DECORATORS: 

In Python, decorators are a powerful concept that allows you to
modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their code directly. 
Decorators are higher-order functions, which means they take another function as an argument and return a new function.
They are denoted by the @decorator_name syntax and are placed just above the function definition.

Decorators are often used for tasks such as 
logging, authentication, memoization, and other cross-cutting concerns that apply to multiple functions. 
They provide a clean and reusable way to add functionality to functions dynamically.
